# **App Name**: AlgoSim

## Core Features:

- Interactive Navigation: Intuitive interface with a dropdown menu for topic selection and 'Next'/'Previous' buttons for step-by-step navigation.
- Question Display: Clear display of the sample question above the simulation area to provide context.
- Algorithm Visualizations: Visualization engine to graphically represent algorithm traversals in trees and graphs, update matrices/tables dynamically, and animate algorithm flow, driven by the JSON simulation files provided earlier. The display shows various states, highlighting comparisons, swaps, and modifications with informative arrows.
- Data-Driven Simulations: Simulation Engine loads external JSON documents representing question state and updates it based on button clicks to show progress towards a solution. Includes ability to rewind to previous states
- Dynamic Question Generation: An AI tool that dynamically rewrites the given sample questions for different sets of inputs to reinforce understanding and challenge the user.
